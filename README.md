# Burn Against Humanity
An implementation of the one time card game, Burn Against Humanity, using Node.js and Socket.io.

A live version is playable [at my website](http://mattriley.me.uk/bah/).

###What is Burn Against Humanity Online?
Burn Against Humanity is a Cards Against Humanity clone, developed by some students who really didn't have anything better to do. The problem is that only one version of the deck exists in the world, and already after only 3 games, looks battered and tired.

So instead we developed Burn Against Humanity Online, a digital, online version of the game, developed mainly as a technical exercise.
